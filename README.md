# OpenGL-Planet

The goal of this project was to try and apply what I learned about instancing in OpenGL. I imported a model of a planet and a model of an asteroid, and used instancing to create lots of asteroids in a ring around the planet.

  **Controls**: Use W, A, S, and D to move, and the mouse to change the direction the camera is facing
